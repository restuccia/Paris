The following is a list of places in Paris that I like, that I want to see, that I deem interesting.
The list includes bars, museum, architecturally interesting buildings, parks, etc. Feel free to email me (mario at this domain) to suggest me new places to add.

# To study

# Cafés/bars
I think most — if not all — cafés in Paris are good for a glass of wine and an acceptable coffee. I do have a preference for the ones that also _look_ good, and are not too fancy or touristy.

- [Café de la Poste](https://goo.gl/maps/saiEZVvLvntYjdSK9) (3éme - République) - A cozy place for a coffee.
- [Le 17](https://goo.gl/maps/yUStuKuPyXLWBHuw7) (11éme) - Small old-style café.
- [Good News Coffee Shop](https://g.page/good-news-coffee-shop-paris?share) (15éme) - To be reviewed. I've been told it's a good take-away American coffee, if you're into that. Looks hipster-y.
- [Au Clair de Lune](https://goo.gl/maps/hvH8hLYYjBitCrDv8) (18éme - Montmartre) - To be reviewed.
- [Le Pop-up du Label](https://goo.gl/maps/ZBQY1w5K7bKBZ7ns7) (12éme - Gare de Lyon) - To be reviewed, maybe a bit hipster but looks very cool.
- [BarOurcq](https://goo.gl/maps/vJDDFVEDajPKFiTk6) (19éme - Canal de l'Ourcq) - Lovely bar in front of the canal. You could also take a beer and drink it while sitting on the _quai_.
- [Le Bistrot du Croissant](https://g.page/bistrot-du-croissant?share) (2éme - Bourse) - Apparently a bar like any other, but in 1914 Jean Jaurès was killed here while having dinner.
- [Ten Belles Bread](https://goo.gl/maps/EbMpgdgCWAAViYBm6) (11éme - Richard Lenoir) - Good place to work/study.
- [La Petite Mutinerie](https://goo.gl/maps/7a5EjTWTHtDECuLE6) (Bois de Boulogne) - Open air bar in the Bois de Boulogne, surrounded by nature.
- [Maison Sauvage](https://goo.gl/maps/hPa1rQJCUJeCWpxc9) (6éme - Odéon) - Fancy, beautiful bar in a building covered by plants. A bit expensive.

# To walk
- [Cité du Figuier](https://goo.gl/maps/Dk9gkVaJM5cFyEGa6) (11éme - Oberkampf) - To be reviewed.
- [Parc de Passy](https://goo.gl/maps/9eos6tUbSdnCD34q7) (16éme - Muette) - To be reviewed.
- [Galerie Le Sevrien](https://goo.gl/maps/Mtq9Tesb8ty4FUjT9) (6éme - Notre-Dame-des-Champs)- Like the Toronto PATH but worse. Also totally out of place.
- [Viaduc de Passy](https://goo.gl/maps/YHhxdxAqDRk91dC66) (16éme - Muette) - The Passy Métro station is elevated between Haussmanian buildings.
- [Cimitière du Montparnasse](https://goo.gl/maps/EwCiHyLz3pbwadJK6) (14éme - Montparnasse) - Well, I like cemeteries. Among the people who are resting here, you can find Julio Cortázar, Serge Gainsbourg, Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.
- [Place des Vosges](https://goo.gl/maps/GmV2yxQfezzUiTv67) (4éme - Le Marais) - A square with a park in the heart of the Marais, surrounded by red brick houses.
- [Place de la Commune de Paris](https://goo.gl/maps/TAs4petwkLo4XB3D9) (13éme - Butte-aux-Cailles) - The neighbourhood of Butte-aux-Cailles is a must see during the day, and full of great bars at night.
- [Square Yves-Klein](https://goo.gl/maps/VbXeWz3QyAZ97Lk3A) (14éme - Raspail) - Yves Klein was an artist, famous for his own colour: the Klein blue. In this very small park, the benches are blue. The building in front of it (31 Rue Campagne Première) is stunning.
- [Square de la Place de La Réunion](https://goo.gl/maps/6hHsGApE6YQRZCku8) (20éme - Charonne) - Nice square, nice neighbourhood. One of Europe's coolest neighbourhoods according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/08/10-of-the-coolest-neighbourhoods-in-europe-paris-berlin-rome).
- [Jardin Mémorial des Enfants du Vel’ d’Hiv’](https://goo.gl/maps/JKWSRotyqVCH5UHd7) (15éme - Champ de Mars) - A monument to commemorate the [Vel d'Hiv' roundup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vel%27_d%27Hiv_Roundup).

- [La Prairie du Canal](https://goo.gl/maps/RtXpgeVdgrxD14bG6) (Bobigny - 93) - A sort of shared garden on the canal.

# Arts and culture
- [Théâtre du Palais-Royal](https://goo.gl/maps/7ccvoKendDxLMYab9) (1er) - Beautiful, small and old theatre. Offers cheap tickets for students.

- [Dalmata Pizza](https://g.page/dalmatapizza?share) (2éme) - Good pizza. Trust me, I'm Italian. Small detail: it's crazy expensive, but it's Paris.
- [Quartier Rouge](https://goo.gl/maps/FLSqa9HEtVMHZUSW9) (20éme - Charonne) - To be reviewed. It was on a Guardian article, so it should be good.
- [Roccolino](https://goo.gl/maps/SVx2ipSeGbS3Vb3z7) (7éme - Rue du Bac) - Small Italian place with delicious panini, very close to SciencesPo.
- [La Massara](https://goo.gl/maps/QjMbD4XBmosyGi2Q7) (3éme - Arts et Métiers) - Sicilian pizzeria, do I need to say more?
- [La Cantine Bretonne](https://goo.gl/maps/rLsUFvR5BPr5jsjF8) (19éme - Canal de l'Ourcq) - Delicious _galettes_ and _crêpes_ from Bretagne. They also have a very good cider.

- [Les Niçois](https://g.page/lesnicoisrestaurant?share) (11éme - Parmentier) - To be reviewed. Specialties from the South of France. They also have a place to play pétanque.
- [Big Falafel](https://goo.gl/maps/Myh6YZrkvyfnAxCw6) (11éme - Saint-Maur) - Korean-Lebanese fusion restaurant (yes, sounds weird but it's very good). The owner is super lovely.
