The following is a list of places in Paris that I like, that I want to see, that I deem interesting.
The list includes bars, museum, architecturally interesting buildings, parks, etc. Feel free to dm me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mario_restuccia) to suggest me new places to add.

# To go out at night
- [L'Alimentation Générale](https://g.page/lalimentation-generale) (11éme - Oberkampf) - Cheap bar, often has live music.
- [Les Sans Culottes](https://goo.gl/maps/i7JMq4ft2Rx4f6d56) (11éme - Bastille) - Old style bistro where you can have a cheap beer.
- [River Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/s8GxW45jFuNbenTU6) (5éme - Pantheon) - To be reviewed.
- [Moki bar](https://goo.gl/maps/1cHc1XTbmQNUPP1z7) (20éme - Charonne) - To be reviewed.
- [Little Red Door](https://goo.gl/maps/wDmNhj3twU2jzHfM7) (3éme - République) - Apparently one of the world's best bars, expect it to be fancy and pricey. I haven't been yet.
- [La Bellevilloise](https://goo.gl/maps/NheKp3wCLu1XrW428) (20éme - Ménilmontant) - A very cool place with concerts and events. Every time I tried to go there, it was packed.
- [La Maroquinerie](https://goo.gl/maps/zV5Cg78zAZ4tzYkt6) (20éme - Ménilmontant) - To be reviewed. Concerts and stuff.
- [Mini Pong](https://goo.gl/maps/L6tXo4LsCzg5pENz6) (9éme - Pigalle) - Tiny bar with very good cocktails.

# To study
- [Bibliothèque François-Mitterrand](https://goo.gl/maps/RbGJirFpLMthShWy7) (14éme - Gare) - A must-see and a great place to study. The annual card is 15 €, but you can visit for free.
- [Bibliothèque Mazarine](https://g.page/BibMazarine) (6éme - Saint-Germain-des-Prés) - Stunning old-style library inside the Institut de France. The pass is 15€/year but you can get a free one for three days.

# Cafés/bars
I think most — if not all — cafés in Paris are good for a glass of wine and an acceptable coffee. I do have a preference for the ones that also _look_ good, and are not too fancy or touristy.

- [Café de la Poste](https://goo.gl/maps/saiEZVvLvntYjdSK9) (3éme - République) - A cozy place for a coffee.
- [Le 17](https://goo.gl/maps/yUStuKuPyXLWBHuw7) (11éme) - Small old-style café.
- [Good News Coffee Shop](https://g.page/good-news-coffee-shop-paris?share) (15éme) - To be reviewed. I've been told it's a good take-away American coffee, if you're into that. Looks hipster-y.

# To walk
- [Cité du Figuier](https://goo.gl/maps/Dk9gkVaJM5cFyEGa6) (11éme - Oberkampf) - To be reviewed.
- [Parc de Passy](https://goo.gl/maps/9eos6tUbSdnCD34q7) (16éme - Muette) - To be reviewed.
- [Galerie Le Sevrien](https://goo.gl/maps/Mtq9Tesb8ty4FUjT9) (6éme - Notre-Dame-des-Champs)- Like the Toronto PATH but worse. Also totally out of place.
- [Viaduc de Passy](https://goo.gl/maps/YHhxdxAqDRk91dC66) (16éme - Muette) - The Passy Métro station is elevated between Haussmanian buildings.
- [Cimitière du Montparnasse](https://goo.gl/maps/EwCiHyLz3pbwadJK6) (14éme - Montparnasse) - Well, I like cemeteries. Among the people who are resting here, you can find Julio Cortázar, Serge Gainsbourg, Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.
- [Place des Vosges](https://goo.gl/maps/GmV2yxQfezzUiTv67) (4éme - Le Marais) - A square with a park in the heart of the Marais, surrounded by red brick houses.
- [Place de la Commune de Paris](https://goo.gl/maps/TAs4petwkLo4XB3D9) (13éme - Butte-aux-Cailles) - The neighbourhood of Butte-aux-Cailles is a must see during the day, and full of great bars at night.
- [Square Yves-Klein](https://goo.gl/maps/VbXeWz3QyAZ97Lk3A) (14éme - Raspail) - Yves Klein was an artist, famous for his own colour: the Klein blue. In this very small park, the benches are blue. The building in front of it (31 Rue Campagne Première) is stunning.
- [Square de la Place de La Réunion](https://goo.gl/maps/6hHsGApE6YQRZCku8) (20éme - Charonne) - Nice square, nice neighbourhood. One of Europe's coolest neighbourhoods according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/08/10-of-the-coolest-neighbourhoods-in-europe-paris-berlin-rome).

# Far from the city
- [Forteresse Du Mont-Valérien](https://goo.gl/maps/CwT8ovC7MvjECdDF7) (92) - Old fort with a nice view.

# Arts and culture
- [Théâtre du Palais-Royal](https://goo.gl/maps/7ccvoKendDxLMYab9) (1er) - Beautiful, small and old theatre. Offers cheap tickets for students.
- [Fondation Louis Vuitton](https://goo.gl/maps/FFCZJminsWBMao4a6) (16éme - Bois de Boulogne) - Beautiful building, hosting modern/contemporary art exhibitions.

# To eat
- [La Felicità](https://goo.gl/maps/JZD5uGgtKRZR5jn78) (13éme - Gare) - La Felicità is a true Italian restaurant, situated inside Station F. One of the few places in Paris where to get a good espresso.
- [Singh](https://goo.gl/maps/FvMr5izYWq5AgB6g7) (5éme - Panthéon) - Good indian food. Only takes cash.
- [Dalmata Pizza](https://g.page/dalmatapizza?share) (2éme) - Good pizza. Trust me, I'm Italian. Small detail: it's crazy expensive, but it's Paris.
- [Quartier Rouge](https://goo.gl/maps/FLSqa9HEtVMHZUSW9) (20éme - Charonne) - To be reviewed. It was on a Guardian article, so it should be good.

# Urbex
